We introduce a canonical hand representation that unifies diverse dexterous hands into a shared parameter space and canonical URDF format, serving as a condition for cross-embodiment policy learning. It enables dexterous grasping and zero-shot generalization to novel hand morphologies, highlighting its potential for a wide range of dexterous manipulation tasks.
